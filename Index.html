	<P>Why hello, thank you for stopping by my site. I am a senior at the University of Maine
	in Orono, studying the exciting world of Finance. In my spare time, when I'm not 
	studying or doing homework, I am a musician. My first love has been (and always will be)
	drums. I started playing drums when I was 15. I never would have thought that music would
	play the role in my life that it has. I welcome you to my site and find out about Zac Wengert.</P>
