 	<P> My music taste has evolved a lot over the years. From Listening to Worship music
 	like

 	. This were I not started getting interested in music. These where the first bands that
 	I saw live as a kid. I specifically remember going with my youth group to a giant youth
 	conference called Aquire the Fire at the University of Massachusetts Lowell's stadium 
 	to see my first concert. The show was Unhindered, Building 429, and headlining was Kutless.
 	I had never realized that you could play music infront of so many people. I specifically
 	remember thinking to myself, "Wow, this is insane. I can't imagine what it's like to be
 	infront of this many people." While all the bands were on stage, I couldn't help but be
 	focused on the drummers. But of the all three of drummers, there was one who stuck out
 	the most. Jeff Gilbert:

 	<P> The crazy mohawk, the head banging, playing with every single fiber of his being. It was
 	something that I couldn't help but be captivated by. It was in so many ways other 
 	worldly. After that, I was just amazed that someone could be so passionate about something.
 	After that, I didn't really go to concerts for a while. And with that my musical taste
 	started to change. I started liking music that had the same enjoy that Jeff was playing
 	with. I started listening to bands that had reverb in their guitars, bands that had some
 	attitude. I started listening to bands like

 	,

 	, and
 	<A HREF="https://foofighters.com"> Foo Fighters </A>
 	. My Mom, not really a fan of such music, told me that I shouldn't be listening to that
 	kind of music. Of course, being a young teenager, I did quite the opposite. Before long
 	I was getting into music that was not only heavy, but had what both my parents couldn't
 	stand: SCREAMING. I was, and still do, listen to bands along the line of

 	, and

 	.</P>
 	
 	<P> Of course with this the evolution of my musical pallet, being a musician, my style
 	of playing matched what I was listening to. I started to play harder, I played with more
 	energy, I played with more intensity. At the time I was most in church, which does not
 	normally call for the bast beats and double bass beats that metal does. So I learned to
 	get this style of playing out through dynamics. This became one of my greatest tools as
 	both a drummer and as an overall musician. It taught me how to get people involved and 
 	intern, it taught me an important lesson at a young age about the "feeling" of music.
 	Not just playing a song like it is written, but adding personality, flair, and putting
 	your own character into a song.</P>
 	
 	<P> Taste in music was and is a huge part of my identity. It brought me to be the person
 	that I am today. Music is not just a set of notes over a period of three or four minutes.
 	Music is an extension of our personality, our character, and for some our biggest dreams 
 	and deepest desires. </P>
