	<P> Zac, Andrew and Christopher. The Three Wengert Boys. My Parents where crazy enough
	to raise three boys. </P>

	<P> I am the oldest, which of course means I'm best and the favorite. I make sure my
	sibling know that I made raising kids and enjoyable for my parents. The next between us
	three is Andrew. Between us three, he is definitely the sports fan and the athlete. He
	is currently a Sophomore at Husson University
	(<A HREF="http://www.husson.edu"> Husson </A>)
	He is hands down one of my best friends and I couldn't ask for a more fun, interesting,
	and genuinely caring brother than Andrew. Growing up we were at each others throats,
	just like any set of brothers, but the occasional "fight" was not uncommon. I am about
	Two and a half years older than him, and even though our main hubbies aren't the same,
	we are now nearly inseparable. We really became friends when I went away to school.
	Once we had time apart to grow and mature a little bit, we had a lot of fun together.
	Now that he lives right in Bangor, we hang out more often than not.

	<P> The youngest of the Wengerts, Chris, was the surprise of us three. I am almost 10 years
	older than him. Like I said, he was the surprise of us all. Chris is definitely the 
	performer of us all. We joke around with him and say that he even came about in a grand fashion.
	Even at a young age, he was always very exuberant and liked the idea of performance and the theater.
	When the opportunity came to be a part of a church production, he was ecstatic and knew
	that it was something he wanted to try. Not only did he get a part in the production, he got the lead role. When he heard there as a local play that
	was having auditions to have extra's for a district musical, he was begging my parents
	let him try out. My parents agreed and he was soon one of the extras. Soon it become clear
	that theater was his passion. He is one of the most quick witted kids I know and his sense
	 of humor is definitely above his age. I remember as a kid when I first heard that my
	 Mom was pregnant with Chris wondering what life will be like with another brother in
	 the house, but now, I could not even kind of imagine life with out him. </P>
